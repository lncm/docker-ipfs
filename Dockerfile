## This set of Docker stages, serves as a base for all cross-compilation targets.
#   `go-base` only defines `GOOS`, which is common to all other ARCH-specific stages.
#   Each supported CPU architecture defines it's own stage, which inherits from `go-base`, and sets up its own ENV VARs.

## This stage prepares the environment for IPFS build:
#   * installs all deps & deps of tests
#   * creates & switches to a non-root user
#   * fetches GPG key to verify cloned source
#   * clones & actually verifies the source
#   * prints the details of the environment
#   * applies necessary fixes to go.mod, and prints the difference
