# This Dockerfile builds, tests, and minimally packages two flavors of IPFS:
#   1. `nofuse`    - only allow for API-level communication
#   2. `fuse`      - enable mounting `/ipns/` & `/ipfs/`, and file system level interactions

# IPFS version to be built
ARG VERSION=v0.4.23

# Target CPU archtecture of built IPFS binary
ARG ARCH

# Define default versions so that they aren't repreated throughout the file
ARG VER_GO=1.14
ARG VER_ALPINE=3.11

# Default user, and their home directory for the `final` stage
ARG USER=ipfs
ARG DIR=/data/

# There are two allowed flavors: `fuse`, `nofuse`
ARG FLAVOR=nofuse

# The level of testing to be performed before creating the `final` stage.  Can be set to: `none`, `simple`, `advanced`
ARG TEST_LEVEL=simple



#
## Prepare IPFS source for building:
#   * install dependencies
#   * Set Go's environment variables
#   * clone source
#   * verify source's signature
#   * prints environemnt details
#   * apply necessary fixes to go.mod, and print the difference
